Who Is a Spine and Pain Specialist?
A spine and pain specialist is a highly trained medical professional who diagnoses, treats, and manages pain caused by spinal, nerve, or musculoskeletal problems. Unlike general physicians, these specialists focus on restoring function and reducing pain using modern non-surgical and interventional techniques.

At Kalyani Hospital, our pain management doctors evaluate each patient carefully to design a treatment plan that targets the root cause — whether it’s a pinched nerve, slipped disc, joint degeneration, or post-surgical pain.
